GrueTris
========

A Tetris clone built with Grue

Grue is a JS Library that still requires a lot of polish, so it lives in a private repo. This means there's little point in forking GrueTris, which is also a work in progress, but you can play it at http://nfeldman.github.io/Tris/. It is fully playable.
